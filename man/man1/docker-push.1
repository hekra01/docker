.SH NAME
.PP
docker\-push \- Push an image or a repository to a registry

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker push\fP
[\fB\-\-help\fP]
NAME[:TAG] | [REGISTRY\_HOST[:REGISTRY\_PORT]/]NAME[:TAG]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command pushes an image or a repository to a registry. If you do not
specify a \fB\fCREGISTRY\_HOST\fR, the command uses Docker's public registry located at
\fB\fCregistry\-1.docker.io\fR by default.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fP
  Print usage statement

.SH EXAMPLES
.SH Pushing a new image to a registry
.PP
First save the new image by finding the container ID (using \fBdocker ps\fP)
and then committing it to a new image name:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker commit c16378f943fe rhel\-httpd

.fi
.RE

.PP
Now, push the image to the registry using the image ID. In this example the
registry is on host named \fB\fCregistry\-host\fR and listening on port \fB\fC5000\fR. To do
this, tag the image with the host name or IP address, and the port of the
registry:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker tag rhel\-httpd registry\-host:5000/myadmin/rhel\-httpd
# docker push registry\-host:5000/myadmin/rhel\-httpd

.fi
.RE

.PP
Check that this worked by running:

.PP
.RS

.nf
# docker images

.fi
.RE

.PP
You should see both \fB\fCrhel\-httpd\fR and \fB\fCregistry\-host:5000/myadmin/rhel\-httpd\fR
listed.
