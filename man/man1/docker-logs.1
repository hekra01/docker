.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBdocker logs\fP command batch\-retrieves whatever logs are present for
a container at the time of execution. This does not guarantee execution
order when combined with a docker run (i.e., your run may not have generated
any logs at the time you execute docker logs).

.PP
The \fBdocker logs \-\-follow\fP command combines commands \fBdocker logs\fP and
\fBdocker attach\fP. It will first return all logs from the beginning and
then continue streaming new output from the containerâ€™s stdout and stderr.

.PP
\fBWarning\fP: This command works only for \fBjson\-file\fP logging driver.
