docker\-tag \- Tag an image into a repository

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBdocker tag\fP
[\fB\-f\fP|\fB\-\-force\fP[=\fIfalse\fP]]
[\fB\-\-help\fP]
IMAGE[:TAG] [REGISTRY\_HOST/][USERNAME/]NAME[:TAG]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Assigns a new alias to an image in a registry. An alias refers to the
entire image name including the optional \fB\fCTAG\fR after the ':'.

.PP
If you do not specify a \fB\fCREGISTRY\_HOST\fR, the command uses Docker's public
registry located at \fB\fCregistry\-1.docker.io\fR by default.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-force\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   When set to true, force the alias. The default is \fIfalse\fP.

.PP
\fBREGISTRYHOST\fP
   The hostname of the registry if required. This may also include the port
separated by a ':'

.PP
\fBUSERNAME\fP
   The username or other qualifying identifier for the image.

.PP
\fBNAME\fP
   The image name.

.PP
\fBTAG\fP
   The tag you are assigning to the image.  Though this is arbitrary it is
recommended to be used for a version to distinguish images with the same name.
Note that here TAG is a part of the overall name or "tag".

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-force\fP=\fItrue\fP|\fIfalse\fP
   Force. The default is \fIfalse\fP.

.SH Tagging an image for a private repository
.PP
To push an image to an private registry and not the central Docker
registry you must tag it with the registry hostname and port (if needed).

.PP
.RS

.nf
docker tag 0e5574283393 myregistryhost:5000/fedora/httpd:version1.0
